# Milliscope

Milliscope is a simple Android sample app built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
It tracks how long each item in a scrollable list remains visible on screen and
updates the visible time in real time.

Created as a learning exercise to explore Jetpack Compose and Android development, specifically for
testing the [visibility modifiers released in Compose UI 1.8](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/whats-new-in-jetpack-compose-august-25-release.html).
